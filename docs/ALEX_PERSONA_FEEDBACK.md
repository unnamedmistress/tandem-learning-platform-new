## Emotional Journey

| Phase | Emotion | Key Quote |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Landing | Intrigued but skeptical | "This looks polished, but is it real learning or gamified fluff?" |
| Onboarding | Engaged | "Oh, they're asking me to bring MY problem. Okay, I'm taking this seriously." |
| Classes | Slightly confused | "The aesthetics are great, but what exactly am I learning?" |
| Lesson Scenario | Excited | "Wait, THIS is prompt engineering. This is exactly what I need." |
| Challenges | Motivated | "Oh, other people struggle with the same things. I can contribute too." |
| Profile | Hopeful | "If the learning actually delivers on this promise, this could be transformative." |

**Likelihood to Continue: 75%** (High, with conditions)

**To reach 90%:**
- See real example of completed lesson with AI feedback
- Clear onboarding explaining the full learning loop
- Personalized recommendation based on goals

**Would drop to 40% if:**
- High paywall discovered
- No real feedback—just self-reflection
- Generic lessons that don't teach specific techniques

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. AI Personalities - Mentioned Never Shown
**Problem:** "I see 4 AI Personalities mentioned, but I haven't encountered them yet"
**Impact:** High - Creates confusion and unmet expectations
**Fix:** Show AI personality selector early, explain what they are

### 2. No Example of Completed Lesson
**Problem:** "Let me see 1-2 completed lessons from a demo user so I understand the full experience"
**Impact:** Critical - Alex can't visualize success
**Fix:** Add "Preview" mode showing completed lesson flow

### 3. Onboarding Gap - What Happens Next?
**Problem:** "I'm not sure what happens if I click 'Start First Attempt'"
**Impact:** High - Creates anxiety, blocks progress
**Fix:** Add preview/tooltip showing the feedback loop

### 4. Pricing Transparency Missing
**Problem:** "Is this free? Freemium? Premium? For an AI-powered platform, there are infrastructure costs. How is this sustainable?"
**Impact:** Medium-High - Creates trust issue
**Fix:** Add pricing info or "Free during beta" badge

### 5. No Personalized Recommendations
**Problem:** "I'm a product manager looking to write better emails and prompts—give me a personalized recommendation"
**Impact:** Medium - Reduces engagement
**Fix:** Add goal-setting onboarding question, then recommend path

### 6. Classes vs Challenges Confusion
**Problem:** "I still don't fully understand the difference between Classes and Challenges"
**Impact:** Medium - Cognitive load
**Fix:** Visual comparison or "Which is right for you?" guide
